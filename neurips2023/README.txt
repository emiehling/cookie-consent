Install instructions:
---------------------

Our simulator is based on RecSim and requires a modified installation. To install from the local setup.py file, run: 

pip install -e .


Run instructions:
-----------------

Parameters of the simulation environment are specified in global_parameters.py.

Simulations are generated by calling main.py with a given set of consent probabilities (across cohorts) and the number of averaging episodes. For example, the following terminal command with start the simulator with consent probabilities (0.25, 0.5) with 50 episodes:

python main.py 0.25 0.5 50


Visualization:
--------------

Output of the simulation is saved to pickle files in the 'data' directory. Plots for a given run can be generated by passing in the parameters of the run, via load_array, into run_viz.py
